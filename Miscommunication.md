# Miscommunication

In my IT ethics class, I had to do a lot of outside reading on Aristotle and Nicomachean ethics, as well as Kant, Jung, and others, to catch up to the assumed basic knowledge of my classmates in these areas. For the first assignment, I chose to use the current Trump trial regarding falsifying documents as my example of poor ethical behavior in a business context. My professor criticized me heavily for this choice. I wasn't considering how people felt about the situation; I simply saw the factual aspects of the story aligning perfectly with the assignment. I forgot that for many Americans, political issues are often viewed through the lens of sports team loyalty.

There is a phenomenon in the use of language that involves the avoidance of language based upon the contradictory denotation of the word or when the connotation has changed over time. Often observed by words reclaimed by communities that historically were seen as pejorative terms. This phenomenon is often referred to as a term becoming "skunked," as presented by Bryan Garner in his Modern American Usage (Kreuz). 
## Explanation of Miscommunication

Ethical and Moral are two words that have been used misinterpreted by me. Our first assignment in Information Technology (IT) ethics with Professor Polliard at Estrella Mountain Community College (EMCC), involved researching a current event fitting the topic of "**poor ethical behavior**" by a corporation. A political figure's trial involving falsifying documents was the dominating story in every news feed online. After reviewing its content, luck had dropped the answers into my lap. I wrote the paper interchanging the words moral and ethical with the misguided notion that they essentially meant the same thing. These words pose major issues within the confines of communication since what one person may believe to be moral, another may believe immoral, and vice versa. What I considered to be poor and clear-cut unethical behavior, my professor did not. 
## Consequences of Miscommunication

My paper returned with a note at the end, and I assumed I had very strong feelings about this topic and situation when the exact opposite was true. I don't really pay too much attention to political news, and being of a very solitary nature, I tend to forget about how many Americans often feel impassioned and emboldened when discussing topics involving politics, sports, and identity that often confuse me. After contacting the professor to try to appease from fear that I had just made my bed for the entire semester and was not looking forward to laying in it, I realized I probably made it worse. Rambling about not caring about American politics and trying to backtrack on my stance only made me seem weak and, ironically, of poor moral fiber.

## Resolution/Reflection

This event led me to begin studying Western philosophy. As someone of mixed cultural, ethnic, and ideological backgrounds, I sometimes misinterpret complex or esoteric concepts of Western culture and philosophy. I chose to pick out as many books on nicomacean ethics by Aristotle as I could find and read about Virtue ethics and the differences between it and morality. Learning that immorality is often used in the persecution of certain people and/or groups my paper gave the impression that, "I passionately felt a certain way about..." as Professor Polliard put it. Knowing these words' denotative and connotative meanings could have saved me months of awkwardness in a class about very hard-to-define concepts.
