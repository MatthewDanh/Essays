# S.M.A.R.T. Goals: Pursuing Academic and Community Excellence
This foundation will ultimately contribute to creating innovative global communication platforms, such as open-source collaboration tools or accessible social networks, underscoring the importance of ethical considerations in every technological endeavor.

## Understanding Ethical and Inclusive Technology

As I pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of ethical and inclusive technology. This educational journey promises to significantly impact the tech sector by enhancing accessibility and cybersecurity. For example, I plan to develop user-friendly interfaces to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities and implement advanced encryption methods to strengthen cybersecurity frameworks. The power of critical thinking and innovative problem-solving drives this journey. I aim to tackle challenges such as bridging the digital divide by developing accessible technology solutions for underserved communities.

Honing essential skills in full-stack web development is imperative, particularly with front-end frameworks like React and back-end technologies like Node.js. Additionally, mastering programming languages like Python and Java, along with I.T. administration involving cloud infrastructure management, is crucial. These skills form the building blocks of a successful career in this field. They enable developers to create robust, scalable solutions, such as designing cloud-based applications that efficiently handle increased user traffic or developing modular software that can be easily expanded as requirements evolve. They also facilitate effective collaboration in multidisciplinary teams and help adapt to rapidly changing technology trends.

## Attaining Educational Milestones

A degree from Phoenix College is a pivotal milestone in my long-term aspirations. This degree will broaden my horizons within the technology landscape, paving the way for dynamic and fulfilling career opportunities in software development, data analysis, and I.T. consulting. Pursuing higher education lays a strong foundation. For example, collaborating on group projects—such as developing a full-stack web application with peers—and participating in class discussions on ethical technology use have helped me develop the skills to foster effective communication within our communities.

## Community Impact and Inclusivity

Beyond individual aspirations, a college education fuels my ambition to establish an LGBTQ+ community and education center in Maricopa County. Maricopa County is home to a growing and diverse population that faces significant gaps in access to support services and resources for marginalized groups. This initiative addresses those gaps by providing essential educational and community-driven programs, such as technology literacy workshops, coding boot camps for underrepresented groups, and support groups focused on LGBTQ+ youth empowerment. The goal is to create a space that celebrates diverse cultures and strengthens the bonds among marginalized groups, fostering a more inclusive and connected society.

Achieving academic success through higher education propels my career in technology while amplifying my commitment to promoting inclusivity, security, and safety in my local community. This journey is about more than personal achievement; it is about cultivating a culture marked by understanding, respect, and collaboration among all individuals.

## Actionable Steps Towards Inclusivity

To contribute to this culture, I plan to:
- Lead at least three workshops on inclusive technology practices within the next year.
- Develop mentorship programs for marginalized communities to support at least 20 participants over the next two years.
- Actively participate in local initiatives that promote diversity in tech, aiming to launch specific events every quarter.
