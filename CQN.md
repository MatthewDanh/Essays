# Why do you want to do research?
The motivation to engage in research is multifaceted and encompasses various personal and professional aspirations. Primarily, research provides a means to contribute to advancing knowledge and understanding in a specific field, as well as the opportunity to address critical issues society faces. In today's rapidly evolving world, the ability to seek out knowledge and curate and present it critically is of utmost importance.

Furthermore, the belief that curation will become as significant a skill as discovery in the current information landscape highlights the need for researchers to adapt and innovate in their approaches to knowledge dissemination. The vast amounts of data and information now accessible necessitate effective methods for framing and presenting knowledge in an accurate and impactful manner.

Moreover, engaging in research offers the prospect of empowering marginalized and underrepresented groups. By ensuring that knowledge is curated and presented equitably, researchers can help to counteract the imbalances that have historically disadvantaged specific populations. This commitment to social justice and inclusivity is an integral aspect of the drive to pursue research, as it aligns with the overarching aim to improve the human condition through the development and dissemination of knowledge.

In summary, my reasons for actively pursuing research driven by a passion for advancing knowledge, acknowledging the growing importance of curation and critical presentation of information, and committing to promote equity and inclusivity for marginalized and underrepresented groups.

# What are your academic aspirations and career goals?
How might participating in this REU help you achieve them?
Academic goals include gaining skills in social justice, activism, and policy-making in order to protect and strengthen the LGBTQ+ community. Obtaining appropriate degrees in sociology, psychology, or public policy allows for a thorough grasp of this community's particular difficulties. It is critical to work with like-minded individuals and groups to build effective equality and inclusion strategies.

The main goal of my career is to establish myself as a well-known leader and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. It is critical to collaborate with organizations, government agencies, and educational institutions to develop tailored policies and initiatives. These objectives include raising awareness, combating prejudice, and building societal understanding and acceptance. Mentoring and supporting LGBTQ+ people, particularly those with restricted prospects, is also critical.

Participating in a REU program focused on social justice and activism provides vital experience with LGBTQ+ issues. Mentoring, networking, and hands-on engagement offered by the program all contribute considerably to accomplishing academic and career goals. Working with specialists and committed colleagues allows for the development of necessary skills, information, and connections, which ultimately benefits the LGBTQ+ community.

# Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself?
To use an analogy from the story "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas," my personal journey has been marked by a constant pursuit of justice and ethical integrity. In the story, Omelas' happiness and prosperity come at the expense of a single child's suffering. While the majority of citizens accept this reality, some choose to walk away, refusing to participate in a society founded on the suffering of an innocent.

Similarly, I have seen firsthand the importance of challenging societal norms and values, especially when they contribute to the suffering or marginalization of vulnerable groups. I have sought to challenge and redefine the status quo throughout my personal and academic journey, striving for a more equitable and compassionate world. This commitment to social justice has led them to participate in a variety of initiatives aimed at uplifting and supporting marginalized communities, such as advocacy, mentorship, and research.

Adversity, grief, and regret have all been a part of my journey, but I have never wavered in my commitment to justice, in the spirit of those who fled Omelas. I hope to continue emulating these values in my future endeavors, always striving to create a world that is just, inclusive, and compassionate to all.
