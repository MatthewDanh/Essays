Hello LGBTQ Professionals group,

I'm Matthew, but in the digital realm, you might know me as Glitch. Delighted to be here!

My world revolves around web development and databases, with a particular soft spot for the evolving landscape of AI and machine learning. I approach technology not just as a tool, but as a canvas for innovation and change. Currently, I'm honing my skills in web app development and APIs, meticulously building my portfolio and resume. 

What sets me apart is my situational learning style, where I connect new concepts to familiar territories, making the complex accessible. This approach has been instrumental in my journey, especially under the mentorship of Gerald Gherke, a seasoned software engineer at UPS. His guidance has been a beacon, illuminating the intricacies of our field.

While I'm keen on exploring opportunities that align with my expertise, I'm equally enthusiastic about the prospect of connecting others with their ideal roles. Networking, for me, is a two-way street. I'm here to learn, share, and, most importantly, facilitate connections that can foster professional growth for all involved.

In this group, I see a chance to not just advance my career but also to be a conduit for others looking to do the same. So, let's collaborate, exchange insights, and see where our professional journeys can take us, individually and together.

Looking forward to meaningful interactions and potential collaborations.

Best,
Matthew (Glitch)
