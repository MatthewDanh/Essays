# Essays Collection

Welcome to my digital writing archive! I'm Matt (Glitch), a student exploring a variety of topics through essays. This repository stores my academic work and serves as a platform for my personal and professional thoughts.

My blog features a variety of content, including academic essays that delve into my research across different subjects, as well as templates I've created to assist with essay writing and organization. You'll also find personal reflections where I share my views and experiences, along with professional insights that focus on development and observations in the workplace. Updates are managed through the 'updated-readme' branch for better organization, and I regularly post articles on topics such as the latest trends in gaming, explorations of diverse perspectives, and insightful book reviews through my Glitched Gaming, Beyond the Rainbow, and The Book Markers series.
